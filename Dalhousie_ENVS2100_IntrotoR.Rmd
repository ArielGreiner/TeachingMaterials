Data Source

ADD PLOT OF THE 6 SITES
----------
https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?packageid=knb-lter-mcr.4.40

Questions:
how does hard coral cover change over time? (i think all of the genera listed are hard coral and the others are non-coral, but double check? what's CTB)
check if >30% or not over time for each site
<look into moorea dataset, reason to expect spatial differences? different sides of the island, types of reefs, type thing)>

NOTES
geographic coordinates verification: https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/metadataviewer?packageid=knb-lter-mcr.4.40
data cleaning before sending it to them
- need to make a 'Site' column by doing some reg ex to extract the site; then add geographic coordinates by matching the site name with the geo coordinates
data cleaning to show them 
- take the average for a site for each of the other columns? maybe
